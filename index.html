	<p>
I’m never afraid of dying because I have already been to heaven that is my family. The only perfect place where I feel most content for being.
</p>
<p>

I never understood that I have such a lovely family. Thank you for being there by my side at my hour of crisis. The journey through the difficult time was easy as you all were there with me.
</p>
<p>
You sacrificed your own happiness, just so that I could be happy. It may take a lifetime, but I’ll do everything to repay for what you have done for me.
</p>
<p>
The only rock I know that stays steady, the only institution I know that works, is the family.
</p>

Family means so much to me. That’s why this day is so special. Our relationships are the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me, and I will hold on to these bounds as long as I can breathe. 

***

On this day, I want to wish you a lot of patience, because every family needs it. Be kind to each other and remember that blood is thicker than water. You will always have each other, no matter what. 

***

There is no such thing as a perfect family. Everyone has problems, misunderstanding is a very common thing. But you will always have each other, so always try to be nice and kind to your family members. 

***

Happy Family Day to you and your loved ones! I hope you are doing great. Wishing you a lot of love and happiness. Hold on to each other, because you will always have your family, even when the world is falling apart.

***

I can’t even explain the love I have for my family. This is the bond that no one can break. I’m so grateful for every minute spent with you. Happy Family Day!
